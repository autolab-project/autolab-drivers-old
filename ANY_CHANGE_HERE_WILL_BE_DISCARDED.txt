This folder is made to be synced with the githu: https://github.com/qcha41/autolab-drivers

Any change that is made here will be overwritten at next:
autolab.DriverManager().update_drivers()

For this very reason we advice the user not to modify the content of this folder and its sub-folders.

Local drivers may be written in the dedicated folder at ../local (from here).

For more infos see: https://autolab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
